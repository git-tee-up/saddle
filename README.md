# Giddyup.Horse Saddle

This is a GitHub pages site that can be used to invite yourself as a collaborator to the [git-tee-up/horse](https://github.com/git-tee-up/horse) repo.

## Usage

Go to the index of this site (`index.html`) in your browser, fill in your GitHub username, and hit `Saddle Up`. If it worked, you'll see a confirmation message on the screen, and you should recieve an email with an invitation link. GitHub does have API limits, so if you're having issues submitting your username, that is one possible reason, and you may have to try again later.
